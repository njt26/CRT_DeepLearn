Introduction to deep learning in genomics

Jupyter notebooks to support lab sessions at NUI Galway's CRT in Genomics Data Science (November 2019)

Lab 1 introduces feed-forward neural networks. We focus on a toy problem -- computing the XOR
function -- and build familiarity with core NN concepts. We hand-code an NN from scratch, and then redo
the job using TensorFlow.

Lab 3 is an application of convolutional neural networks to a (simulated) genomics problem: finding DNA
binding site motifs. This lab is based loosely on the tutorial associated with Zou et al. (2019),
'A primer on deep learning in genomics', Nature Genetics 51, pp. 12-18
(https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0295-5).

(Labs 2 and 4 to be uploaded in future.)
